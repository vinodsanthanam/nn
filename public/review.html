        Positives:
        Despite your busy schedule at Kaiser with so many teams and managing client, you are still able to catch up with everyone. All of us appreciate that a lot.

        I really admire your ability to stay calm and patient through wild conversations at Kaiser. Couple of examples where I noticed this
        - Trying to explain Feature toggle to AEM team.
        - Talking to Zumruth about processes
        </p><p>

        Observation:
        Lately you appear to be quite drained. Either you need to take more frequent breaks or start delegating some stuff to others.

        What I like about working with you?
        </p><p>
        - I like your approach to problem solving, how you make us think through it and question us. It makes us think in more depth and makes us better problem solvers. You help us solve our own problems
        - You are very approachable and I feel like I can say whatever's on my mind
        - You have earned a lot of respect from your peers because of your persistence and your passion to making this account a good place. You are also very diligent about process improvements and always questions why we should do a certain thing
        </p><p>
        What you think I can do better or change?
        </p><p>
        - A bit more of involving others folks on the account on key issues, just felt sometimes you were the only one trying to fight battles for us 
        </p><p>
        Any other comments?
        </p><p>
        - Its been an absolute pleasure working with you. We've worked at Gap before but I got to see a lot more of you in action here at Kaiser.  Don't know how long Kaiser will last, but I'd love to work with you in the future

        First, I want to say that I've enjoyed working with you over the last few months.  You've helped give context on the ThoughtWorks 'way' of doing things, and been a good source of onboarding support.
        </p><p>
        What I've liked:
        - your attention to onboarding everyone and making sure they're brought up to speed
        - your positive attitude in staying engaged despite being increasingly frustrated at a difficult client.  
        - the energy you bring to the project, your responsiveness to my requests, and your willingness to pitch in on anything.
        - you do project management well, driving commitments and schedules with people
        </p><p>
        What I think could be better:
        - we've had some discussions that seem to get twisted into strangely semantic arguments; maybe if you (and I) can keep an eye on the bigger picture

        Overall, great work.  Thanks again for your help in working with a tough client!

        Now that I'm on a project without you, i can much better see how great of a scrumwhatever you were. You did a really good job of keeping the team focused, and the stories flowing, whether that was writing them, wrangling Chris, or keeping unnecessary political things away from us. the snacks flowed as well. i really enjoyed our catchups and how direct we could be with each other about what was going on in the account. i think you did a good job caring for the thoughtworkers on the team, and keeping people at least moderately happy, and motivated. if it was a pep rally, or a certain type of work they wanted to do to keep going, you seemed to do your best to make it happen, catering to individuals' needs when you saw the chance. although it seemed a little harsh, you also did well getting some of our client friends to work more sensibly. You responded to feedback quickly when I brought up the more transparency would be better thing. i would definitely like to work with you again, and i don't think I have any good suggestions for what you can be doing different.
